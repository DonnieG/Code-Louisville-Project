I have made a webpage representing a Seafood Distribution company which imports and sells seafood.  Many of the issues I had when coding the site were related to syntax and generally being new to coding.  To solve the issues I relied on what I had learned and researched how to approach a problem.  The mentors were extremely helful when I had problems and couldn not find a solution.

In order to run the webpage, use the "Clone or Download" button to obtain the file.  In the folder you will find the HTML file.  Open this file with your preferred web browser and the web page will load.

1.  .main-header

2.  .img

3.  .navbar

4.  .container

5.  .main-footer

6.  .products

7.  .img-responsive
